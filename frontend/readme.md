# Frontend

- Create UI using React.

## TODO:

Use the RESTful API you created in `/backend`

You need to create a simple counter application that can do the following:

- Add a named counter to a list of counters
- Increment any of the counters
- Decrement any of the counters
- Delete a counter
- Show a sum of all the counter values

Please add tests. Use `jest` test framework or something similar.

## Plus points

- Working Demo (deployed on Heroku, Netlify or something similar)
